--------------------------------------------------------
I have done some non trivial programming in the following programming languages:

[  ] NONE

[Y ] JAVA  

[  ] C

[  ] C++

[  ] FORTRAN

[  ] PASCAL

[  ] PHP

[  ] PYTHON

[  ] PERL

[  ] RUBY

[  ] BASH or SH or CSH or KORN etc

[  ] MATLAB

[  ] VISUAL BASIC



List any computer science courses you have taken in High School/College/Tech School etc.


1) C Programming Language


2) _________________________



I understand these concepts from arithmetic:

[Y] arithmetic operators  + - / *

[Y] precedence of operations

[Y] boolean logic  AND NOT OR XOR




I understand these concepts from set theory:

[N] union, intersection

[N] set difference

[N] XOR

[N ] cardinality, membership


I understand the following programming concepts fairly well:

[Y] a variable

[Y] data types such as integer floating point string boolean

[Y] an if else statement

[Y] iteration & loops  such as while loop, for loop, do loop

[Y] method/functions/subroutines

[Y] passing parameters and return values

[Y] arrays

[N] reading writing files

[N] recursion

[N] backtracking

[N] dynamic programming


It has been this long since I have written a non trivial program

[ ] Never wrote any programs

[ ] more than a couple months

[Y] over a year

[ ] a few years



I have heard that this course is:

[ ] very easy 

[ ] moderately easy

[Y] hard

[ ] extremely hard

[ ] heard nothing about it / no idea
