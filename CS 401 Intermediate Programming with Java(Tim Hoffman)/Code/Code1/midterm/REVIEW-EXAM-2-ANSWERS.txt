1) What's incongruitous about how we wrote/used the printHI() method?
  (Hint: it compiles and executes fine)

	public class Q5
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			printHi();
		}

		public static int printHi()
		{
			System.out.println("Hello!");
			return 1;
		}
	}
	
	< answer here >: printHi() returns an int but we never use at the call site


2) What's wrong with this program ? 

	Random r = new Random(10);
	int[] arr = new int[10];
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		arr[i] = r.nextInt(101);
	arr[i - 1] = 0;

	Won't compile: The variable i is not in scope after the for loop is finished

3) Without using a compiler, write a method that receieves an int as a param and returns it as a String.

	public String atoi( int i )
	{
		return ""+ i;
	}



4) There are 2 primary things the keyword "new" does in the follow code segment, "int[] arr = new int[10]".
	What are they?

	Creates the array object with 10 ints in 
	Returns the address of (reference to) the array object
