#21:    Because it will waste a lot of memory, a 5 letter word will have 5! combination(no consider duplicate),
		but we only need to generate one sorted word for each word using our compare way.

#22     If we just increase it by one, everytime when we add a number into the array, we will do the upsize method,
		and each time we do the upsize method, we will create a new array, it will waste a lot of memory.
